# GA Student Forum #

GA Student Forum is an application designed for GA students to upload content that they found useful in **learning a new technology/skill**. Users can **upload links** and **screenshots** to tutorials/articles with information that was helpful for them to learn these new topics. I came up with this application because I thought it would be helpful to have one place where GA students can add content that is specific to the topics we learn in class.

 This app can also be translated to any platform or organization in that most organizations need a space to guide their employees when working on a team with people of various skill levels. My goal for this application was to **create a space online** where people within my cohort could have a **one stop shop** for uploading content that they found useful.
